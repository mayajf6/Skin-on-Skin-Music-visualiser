# Skin-on-Skin-Music-visualiser

Users are required to import Minim into their processing library to utilise the program.

My code also allows the users to insert any mp3 file by renaming the audio file name to “song” and placing it in the data folder, which will create random visualisations from the data extracted. 

I designed a visualisation of music through code to an electronic audio “Burn Dem Bridges” by Skin on Skin utilising the programs Processing and Minim. Utilising Java Language to interact with audio files will create random and unique music visualisations by analysing the bass and treble. This is interesting because music visualisation is becoming extremely predominant in live performances in this current age helping artists draw audiences into their music. Furthermore, it combines both sound and vision immersing the viewer into the track assisting audiences' perception of the performer's emotions bridging the physical gap between them. The current state of my project is complete and working, due to no previous coding experience rather than developing a complicated project I chose to create a simple visualisation.
